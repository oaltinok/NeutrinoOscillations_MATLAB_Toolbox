#Neutrino Oscillations MATLAB Toolbox

About: MATLAB functions enhanced with GUI used to simulate neutrino oscillations in matter. Simulation results may help future neutrino physics experiments.


Collaborators: Prof. Anthony Mann (Theory)


Technologies: MATLAB, MATLAB GUIDE

## Setup

#### MATLAB Application
* Install Application using Neutrino Oscillations.mlappinstall
* From Application List run "Neutrino Oscillations"

#### Run From Source
* Change scope to Source Folder
* Run Neutrino_Oscillation.m function. 
    * It will add necessary directories and runs the latest version of the GUI.

## Usage
1. Set Parameters
2. Press Button:
    * "Muon-Electron" 
        * Calculates and Plots Neutrino Oscillation Probability from Muon to Electron
    * "MINOS" or "NOVA" 
        * Calculates and Plots Event Rate for MINOS or NOVA experiments
    * "Plot" on RHS
        * Calculates and Plots Neutrino Oscillation Probability probability varying for different Epsilon Values
